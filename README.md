# Hiring Homework Exercise for PayByPhone

This is an example app to demonstrate my programming skills. It uses AngularJS, Bootstrap, node.js, and makes calls with the Yelp API.

### Pre-Requisites

Need to have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your computer. These programs will automate the setup process for the required Ubuntu/node.js environment.

1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. [Download and install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

### Initial Use

For the first use, go through the setup process for the environment. In a future boot, your environment will already be setup, so it will only need to be launched. How to setup:

1. Download git repo into a local folder on your computer.

2. Open "Terminal" (Mac), or "Windows Powershell" (Windows; make sure to "Run as Administrator"), and `cd` to your git repo folder.

3. Type `vagrant up` and hit Enter.

4. Wait... (takes about 3-5 minutes)

5. Open in your browser: [http://192.168.90.60](http://192.168.90.60)

### Subsequent Use

1. Open "Terminal" (Mac), or "Windows Powershell" (Windows & "Run asAdministrator"), and `cd` to your git repo folder.

2. Type `vagrant up` and hit Enter.

4. Wait... (less than 30 seconds)

5. Open in your browser: [http://192.168.90.60](http://192.168.90.60)
